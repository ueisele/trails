# Trail Data Analysis

Exploratory analysis and experimentation with trail data using Jupyter notebooks.

## Overview

This directory contains:
- **Notebooks** - Interactive analysis and visualization
- **Scripts** - One-off analysis tools
- **Cache** - Local data storage (git-ignored)

## Getting Started

### Launch JupyterLab

```bash
command make notebook
```

### Notebooks

- `01_data_exploration.ipynb` - Initial exploration of Norwegian trail data from Geonorge

Each notebook is self-contained and downloads/caches its own data.

## Structure

```

├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks
├── scripts/            # Analysis scripts
├── docs/               # Notebook descriptions
├── .cache/             # Local cache (git-ignored)
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Note

This is an exploratory workspace. Code here can be messy and experimental. Production code belongs in `libs/src/trails/`.

## Exporting to Production

When analysis code is mature and reusable:
1. Move it to `libs/src/trails/`
2. Add tests in `libs/tests/`
3. Import in notebooks: `from trails.analysis import your_function`
